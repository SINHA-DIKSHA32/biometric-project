Engineered a biometric patient identification system utilizing fingerprint scanning; reduced patient record retrieval time  by 60%, enabling faster access to critical medical information for clinicians 
Healthcare systems worldwide face increasing challenges related to patient identification, data 
security, and record retrieval inefficiencies. Traditional methods relying on manual data entry 
often lead to errors, duplications, and delays that can compromise patient care. The Biometric
Based Patient Record Retrieval System introduced in this project offers a robust solution by 
integrating fingerprint recognition technology to streamline patient record management. 
This system achieves high accuracy (96.8%) and rapid response times (1.7 seconds per lookup), 
overcoming previous inefficiencies in healthcare record handling. Fingerprint recognition, owing 
to its uniqueness and permanence, proves to be a reliable biometric modality, ensuring patient 
identity verification without dependence on traditional credentials such as ID cards or passwords.
